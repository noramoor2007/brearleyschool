#### **Eugene Williams and the Chicago Race Riot (1919)**
- **Incident**: Eugene Williams, a Black youth, was murdered on July 27, 1919, after entering a white-designated area of Lake Michigan. A white man struck him, causing his drowning.

- **The Riot**: Five days of violence ensued, resulting in:
  - 23 Black and 15 white deaths.
  - Over 537 injuries.
